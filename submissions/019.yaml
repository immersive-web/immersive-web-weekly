      In collaboration with costume designer, Urs Dierker, Michael Jelbart, Helsinki-based XR developer, created a cheery AR Business Card featuring shiny bean-like shapes gently spinning, and linking to the artist’s portfolio.
      For the Helsinki Design Week, the team also translated a costume from exhibition Naturally Dramatic into an accessible WebAR experience. The sustainable textile and material design for stage and film costumes exhibition reached a wider audience despite the limited openings due to COVID 19. The photogrammetric model is displayed using model-viewer with a custom link for Chrome on iOS. Enjoy the experience!
