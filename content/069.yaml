  It was a bit hard to concentrate when editing this issue because the [WebXR Design Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0H6PQUKNbc) is currently hosting a series of panels with excellent people saying interesting things. At the same time, the [Lynx kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stanlarroque/lynx) is fully funded, Magic Leap is showing [pics of v2](https://twitter.com/MadewMagicLeap/status/1447634952351268867), HTC is [teasing a new stand-alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMmOwSl3IO4), and the [CombineReality](https://combinereality.com/) kickstarter is coming soon so the hardware space is heating up.
