      This August 24th [town hall event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/webxr-business-summit-town-hall-open-forum-tickets-166537186207) will gather input from the immersive web business community about what should be covered in the upcoming WebXR Business Summit. When I hosted a similar summit (but for developers) we held a town hall and it was crucial in helping us plan so if you have ideas and needs for the business summit then it's a great idea to attend the town hall.

      Back in [issue 44](https://immersivewebweekly.com/issues/044/) I covered [ARBase](https://arbase.io/), an experimental plugin for the full-featured, browser-based CAD program, OnShape, that brings CAD into WebXR sessions. Well, ARBase is now live and in production [on the OnShape app store](https://appstore.onshape.com/apps/Rendering/P22A6LETENGBFNT5A2VGSTU3S6WBRLDX2C2R5UI=/description), allowing designers to save their work to the cloud and then share them with clients via WebXR.
