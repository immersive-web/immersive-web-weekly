  This issue marks the first anniversary of the day that I took up the editor position for the Immersive Web Weekly. After 50 issues and one roller-coaster of a year for everyone on Earth, I'm happy to report that our collective work to create a wider web is gaining momentum with creators, users, and even the normally reluctant mainstream press. One of the most powerful web companies in the world just declared that it's pivoting to become a "metaverse company". Scrappy teams that use WebXR throughout their technologies are being pulled into the tech world's motherships through acquisition where they will spread the word about no-install, standards-based XR apps. XR events are no longer news-worthy because they're now such a common occurrence.

    __You all are incredible and I love your work.__

    Put on your party hat, strap on your dancing shoes, and make room for a slice of cake because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

      In August of 2022 the proprietary [Oculus APIs for mobile and PC VR will be deprecated](https://developer.oculus.com/blog/oculus-all-in-on-openxr-deprecates-proprietary-apis/) and OpenXR standard APIs will be used for all future development. The Unity and Unreal Engine plugins for Facebook's devices are moving to OpenXR. Let's hope that this kind of standards support will be standard operating procedure in [their new Metaverse division](https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview).
