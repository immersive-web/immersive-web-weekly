overview: >
  The XR cup overflowed this week with hours of new experiences ranging from a visit to an inspirational artificial life simulation, through a rocking session of synthwave AR, and then ending with a game that is most certainly not Tetris. Combine that fun with a flock of new educational works and code releases and it's truly a strong showing for our community.
