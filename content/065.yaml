  I took a bit of time away from [skiing](https://constructarcade.com/game/ski-fit-365/) and [sending love letters](https://youtu.be/cGF3H_JqrTA) to be amazed and awed by the progress in the wider web community. Three new modules hit the standards track, Apple triggered a discussion about declarative scenes, Kent Bye hit a milestone, and Ada Rose gave us loop-de-loops.

    title: First Public Working Drafts of Depth Sensing, Hit Test, and DOM Overlay Modules

      Three WebXR modules hit a big milestone, moving from the community group where specifications are incubated into the working group where specifications are turned into standards. At the same time, the specification documents were published as a "First Public Draft" to invite feedback from the wider web community. The [depth sensing module](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-webxr-depth-sensing-1-20210831/) provides an API to receive surface information about objects like walls and furniture in the physical world. The API described in the [hit test module](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-webxr-hit-test-1-20210831/) provides distance information between XR devices and physical objects. The [DOM Overlay module](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-webxr-dom-overlays-1-20210831/) gives creators the ability to place web content like 2D text, images, and controls on top of 3D scenes.

    title: Apple Proposes <model> to Compliment WebXR

      Long-time Safari engineer and occasional WebXR group contributor Dean Jackson created quite a stir by [proposing a new HTML element, `model`](https://github.com/WebKit/explainers/tree/main/model), which would parallel the existing `audio` and `video` elements but to provide 3D scene rendering instead of sound or flat video. It would appear, based on comments from Apple's head of WebKit engineering, [Maciej Stachowiak](https://twitter.com/othermaciej/), that [Apple remain committed to implementing WebXR](https://twitter.com/othermaciej/status/1432517526202687491) and the new element would be a declarative compliment to the more programmatic APIs like WebXR.

      Kent Bye is arguably the most consistent and thorough journalist covering the current wave of XR culture in his podcast, Voices of VR. He recently published episode 1000 (!!) in the form of a retrospective on the [ultimate potential of virtual reality](https://voicesofvr.com/1000-voices-of-vr-retrospective-on-the-ultimate-potential-of-virtual-reality/) that includes interview excerpts from many of our community members.
