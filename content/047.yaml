  An Apple Event starts in 30 minutes from when I write this but it's still time for me to push "publish". If the fruit team finally pull back the curtain on a pair of Mountain View Viewers and a version of Safari that supports WebXR then the industry will release a collective sigh of relief. If, more likely, there's some other reason that all of their event imagery has digital information reflected on eyeglasses then the same people will still release a collective sigh of relief. Status quo!

      In what is one of the shortest periods of time that I've seen between an initial spec and a shipped feature, Rik Cabanier of Facebook [announced](https://twitter.com/rcabanier/status/1383216671725264900) that the [WebXR Hands API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-hand-input/) (still a draft) is now on by default in Quest's browser.

      Last week the team that produced the WebXR Awards announced [the WebXR Developer Summit](https://webxr.event/) but before that event your faithful editor will host a [rapid-fire town hall](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/webxr-town-hall-developer-summit-open-forum-tickets-150986541811) on Zoom and in Discord. I want to hear from many more people than we can fit into the summit. I'll ask you what you want me to cover on May 25th and also what you want from the immersive web over the next couple of years. Free tickets are available for the [town hall event on May 2nd](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/webxr-town-hall-developer-summit-open-forum-tickets-150986541811) and the [developer summit on May 25th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2021-webxr-developer-summit-tickets-149418602061).

      In this 12 minute video tutorial you'll see how to implement a climbing game that runs on the Wonderland Engine. One of the advantages of these all-in-one editor/engine/hosting platforms is that the development of prototypes can be rapid and then those prototypes can be iteratively and collaboratively turned into shippable experiences.

      The turbulent world of blockchain-based technologies has a nice pocket of calm (and reduced pollution) in the form of XR experiences shared via [Hic et Nunc](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/). Developer Mario Carrillo [announced](https://mobile.twitter.com/marioecg/status/1384195565857107971) that he's released an easy to use [template for creating Three.js-based eco-NFTs](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/tree/main/templates/html-three-template).

      The new release of the Chrome browser has moved [lighting estimation in WebXR](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5704707957850112) from an origin trial to being on by default. As [demonstrated here](https://storage.googleapis.com/chromium-webxr-test/r872931/proposals/lighting-estimation.html), this gives creators [information about the lights in the environment](https://github.com/immersive-web/lighting-estimation/blob/main/lighting-estimation-explainer.md) so that they can (optionally, of course) render their digital information to better blend into physical reality. Version 90 also shipped [an origin trail of the WebXR depth API](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5742647199137792) which provides creators with information about the geometry of their environment.

      [This tweet](https://twitter.com/bai0/status/1382610412768665605) and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/KZytXH2yalg) by long-time immersive web engineer [James Baicoianu](https://twitter.com/bai0/) caused quite a bit of excitement this week. By enabling WebXR sessions inside the Electron app framework there is a real possibility that immersive web applications will be accepted by native-centric app stores like the Oculus Store and Steam. This opens up another path for payment for web developers.

      BabylonJS contributor Justin Murray about the logical error of limiting core concepts to a single XR mode:
      <blockquote>After further conversation and investigation, we concluded that it actually is possible for an experience to need both teleportation and anchors. In fact, an example of such an experience was first prototyped and demoed more than five years ago. The problem, we realized, was that our definition for teleportation had been flawed: instead of defining teleportation in terms of changing the POV position, we should have defined it in terms of changing the real-to-virtual world correspondence. That simple redefinition completely reframed our understanding of the relationship between teleportation and anchors, allowing us to recognize that a single experience can, in fact, very reasonably require both features.</blockquote>

      Funded in part by Arts Council England, this team provides a variety of pain management experiences:
      <blockquote>Within this virtual reality experience, you will be guided to create your own, life-sized body map, which visualizes and explores lived experience. You will be led through a series of meditative and creative activities based on the tenets of mindfulness during the body mapping process in order to help articulate and visually express experiences of the every day and experiences of pain, emotion and sensory experience.</blockquote>

If you read this far, dear reader, then I'll tell you a secret: My middle initial has always been 'F' but before it stood in for 'Flowers' it was for 'Frederick'. 🤫
