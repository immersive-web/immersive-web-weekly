      David Snopek from Snopek Games [writes](https://www.snopekgames.com/blog/2020/how-make-vr-game-webxr-godot):
      <blockquote>For the last few weeks I've been working on adding support for WebXR to the Godot game engine and recording periodic progress report videos on YouTube. Things are to a point where it'd be useful for other folks to try it out to help find bugs and give feedback on the APIs. So, I've decided to write this short tutorial on how to use a development build to make a VR game!</blockquote>

      The Immers Space team recently received funding from the new [Grant For The Web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/) program. Coil, Mozilla, and Creative Commons joined forces to create this program and in the case of Immers Space it energizes development of federation technologies for web spaces. The team [writes](https://web.immers.space/2020/10/lets-save-the-metaverse-from-corporate-domination/):
      <blockquote>We dream of a democratized new era of the Web where creators own their content, users own their data, and no single entity exhibits undue influence on the community as a whole. Immers Space seeks to free the Immersive Web from past pitfalls by using a decentralized model based on open Web standards such that it cannot be owned and controlled by a tech giant oligopoly, bringing people together across platforms in live shared experiences, and providing content creators an alternative monetization model that respects user privacy.</blockquote>
