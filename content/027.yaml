  As usual, 2020 has delivered an exciting week of technology and transformation. After I put this issue to bed I plan to retire into a [tranquil writing space](https://twitter.com/zach_geek/status/1328071767043301378) and work on my folio of immersive poetry.<br>
  Sharpen your pen nibs, rehydrate your dried inks, and scrape clean your parchment because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

      The Babylon.js team seems pretty excited by their [4.2 release](https://babylonjs.medium.com/babylon-js-4-2-simplicity-reimagined-965f88d0fad) and from the WebXR [docs](https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/webXR/introToWebXR), [change-log](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/dist/what's%20new.md#webxr), and [demo](https://catchgame--babylonjs-webxr-demo.netlify.app/) they might be on to something. [Ranaan Weber](https://blog.raananweber.com/) has been especially busy with XR integration but kudos to the entire team for the big release.

      It feels like more people are picking up WebXR because every week I run across interesting projects like this [experience editor](https://blocks-editor.gatunes.com/) from [Daniel Esteban Nombela](https://twitter.com/DaniGatunes). The [demo video](https://youtu.be/rDMLVdFtnYo) and [examples](https://github.com/danielesteban/blocks-editor-examples) show that this [open source project](https://github.com/danielesteban/blocks-editor) has a lot of potential.

      One designer's approach to [widening VR's reach](https://debugger.medium.com/the-oculus-go-a-hard-ware-problem-for-black-women-225d9b48d098):
      <blockquote>
      For my study, I used the Oculus Go device by Facebook. I chose that device because it was easy to use and lightweight. I can use the device anywhere and pre-downloaded all my content so that Wi-Fi wouldnâ€™t be an issue. From an accessibility perspective, the Go felt like the right decision. But that was before I realized that Black hair was going to be a major issue for the completion of my work.

      2020 provided AIGA St. Louis with a hard design problem for their [annual design show](https://stldesignshow.com/) and the immersive web was a part of the solution. With the help of a [local agency](https://paradowski.com/) they created a [custom Hubs space](https://stldesignshow.com/show) for the event. Podcast host Kent Bye [recorded a guided tour](https://youtu.be/-5nBKSyFKEM) of the space and show entries, as well.

      Last week I covered the Global XR Bootcamp and this week the organizers have graciously released all of the talks and sessions in a [YouTube play-list](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHulrhe_CI0hJl00OeJBYJC5nH9jLwTvT). There are a variety of XR-related topics but these popped out as particularly interesting for immersive web creators:
      <br>
      - [UI Design for WebXR](https://youtu.be/rzNm_XL4j7w)<br>
      - [Increasing Scope of WebXR Projects](https://youtu.be/AxZZfQn15_A)<br>
      - [Taking Web Based XR to the Hololens](https://youtu.be/5hlYROeE9LY)
