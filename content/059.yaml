overview: >
  This week saw a major broadcasting group ship a VR experience, a raft of progress on glTF tools and standards, and some actual coverage of web XR by the usually native-centric VR press. Slow and steady wins this race.
  <br>Top off the tanks, retract the support tower, and check in with mission control because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

summary: Lovely text, Sculpting, Indices of Refraction, and PBS

      A new version of Wonderland arrived, most notably with skinning and animation support for FBX files. This is a common file format used in the 3D industry so this opens up more of the standard workflows used by technical artists. One point of interest: some feature development was sponsored by [Playko](https://www.playko.com/).
