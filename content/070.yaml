  I took a break from playing [whack-a-mole](https://acodedoer.github.io/aframe-whack-a-mole/) to check in on the immersive web community and wow are you all staying busy! I've heard from a fair number of people that recent announcements of new XR hardware (and a few that are coming soon) have renewed their optimism about the possibility of open and trustworthy XR on the web.

  Burn your firmware, mill your injection molds, and submit your certification docs because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

If it is successful, I can place a transparent 3d scan of the castle. The bullets and splashes interact with the placed castle."</blockquote>
