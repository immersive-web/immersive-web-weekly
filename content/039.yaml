  The WebXR Awards ceremony was this past Saturday and I had a blast hanging out "backstage" with the nominees and other presenters. It's no small task to produce a fully distributed awards show that is streamed live into several flat video platforms as well as into a raft of shared immersive spaces. I already look forward to next year's event.

      This week two browser teams announced that they intend to ship standards support for the immersive web.
      <br />
      The Chrome team already shipped WebXR Device API support and this week [announced](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/v4fneq7tgDA/m/utkwOcjuAwAJ) that they intend to add support for the [latest draft of the Web XR Depth API](https://immersive-web.github.io/depth-sensing/).
      <br />
      Though there has been work on WebXR in WebKit for quite a while, Apple's Safari team made it official by [updating the standard's status to "In development"](https://webkit.org/status/#specification-webxr) on their public facing tracker.

      The recently open sourced Tilt Brush application is now [up and running on WebXR](https://msub2.github.io/silk-brush/) thanks to work by Daniel Adams. The [source code of the port](https://github.com/msub2/silk-brush) is available for interested developers. A fair amount of work remains to make it speedy and thoroughly cross-platform but launching and handling input is quite a milestone to reach in so little time.
