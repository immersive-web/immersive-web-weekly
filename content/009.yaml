  Oh, hi, I didn't see you come in. It's been a while. But it is 2019!
  And there have been a lot of updates and progress on the [WebXR Device API]!
  Enjoy, my winter and summer pals.

      The Immersive Web WG/CG met last week to tackle some outstanding issues in the
      [WebXR Device API] spec. Topics like controllers/input, session creation, and AR features
      (hit test, anchors) were addressed over the two days (meeting minutes
      [Jan 29](https://www.w3.org/2019/01/29-immersive-web-minutes.html),
      [Jan 30](https://www.w3.org/2019/01/30-immersive-web-minutes.html)), as resolutions
      and decisions make their way to the [specification's Github repo](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr).

      Apple released [Safari 12.1 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari_release_notes/safari_12_1_release_notes)
      this week which requires OS opt-in for the [devicemotion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/devicemotion)
      and [deviceorientation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/deviceorientation) web APIs.
      These APIs expose data from (mostly mobile) devices' gyroscope and accelerometer, which is used
      to synthesize a user's view orientation for Cardboard VR experiences as well as web-based AR
      experiences. These APIs are also abused for [terrifyingly accurate fingerprinting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1416)
      ([for real](https://www.wired.com/story/mobile-websites-can-tap-into-your-phones-sensors-without-asking/)) and lack
      the permission model of newer APIs, like its successor [Generic Sensors](https://www.w3.org/TR/generic-sensor/).
      This will break XR experiences using these APIs on iOS (like [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/3976), or anything
      built on the [WebVR Polyfill]) unless users opt-in to exposing these APIs.
      There's [discussion on the deviceorientation spec](https://github.com/w3c/deviceorientation/issues/57) about adding
      a permission model to the API for a solution somewhere between deanonymizing users and
      breaking all existing XR web content on iOS.
