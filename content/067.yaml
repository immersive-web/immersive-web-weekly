  I took a moment away from [making 20 tiny Memex](https://youtu.be/Bq3YVh-Eqd4) to check in with activity on the immersive web and there's a lot going on! The WebKit team seems to be playing a solid game of catch-up, Khronos is looking forward to ubiquitous scanning, and creators continue to blow minds with new experiences.

  Fill your gas canisters, check the light seals on your microfilm development chambers, and prep your documents for scanning into trails because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

summary: LIDAR, Dingo Gap, WebXR for WebKit, and UW Demo Day

      WebKit WebXR Support: Coming Soon?

      The [meta-bug that tracks development of WebXR on WebKit](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=208988) (the web engine used by Apple) shows that most of the dependencies are marked complete and what remains is testing-related. Undoubtedly, tests will reveal more bugs but this is still a bit of a milestone on the road to WebXR on iOS, padOS, and macOS. Combined with new WebGL2 support in Safari 15, this seems like forward motion for the immersive web on Apple devices.

      [Beatboxes](https://zeblocks.com/beatboxes.html) are 841 generated rooms available as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. While the general idea of A-frame experiences available as NFTs has been around for more than a year, Beatboxes is notable because the rooms have [apparently](https://opensea.io/collection/art-blocks-playground) been [purchased](https://dune.xyz/rantum/Art-Blocks?date=2021-06-15%2000%3A00%3A00&ProjectID=145) for a relatively large amount of money compared to other immersive web experiences.
