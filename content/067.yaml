  I took a moment away from [making 20 tiny Memex](https://youtu.be/Bq3YVh-Eqd4) to check in with activity on the immersive web and there's a lot going on! The WebKit team seems to be playing a solid game of catch-up, Khronos is looking forward to ubiquitous scanning, and creators continue to blow minds with new experiences.

  Fill your gas canisters, check the light seals on your microfilm development chambers, and prep your documents for scanning into trails because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

      The [meta-bug that tracks development of WebXR on WebKit](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=208988) (the web engine used by Apple) shows that most of the dependencies are marked complete and what remains is testing-related. Undoubtedly, tests will reveal more bugs but this is still a bit of a milestone on the road to WebXR on iOS, padOS, and macOS.
