  This week was quite busy for this community and for me. On the heels of releasing a small [mechatronics product](https://transmutable.com/goods/) and [starting one with more ambition](https://twitter.com/TrevorFSmith/status/1388494858797543425), we held a town hall meeting to collaboratively choose topics for the [WebXR Developer Summit](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2021-webxr-developer-summit-tickets-149418602061) on May 25th. Seeing everyone's excellent ideas and directions in the town hall and then waking up early this morning to a flood of notifications about news for this issue, I feel like we've pushed the WebXR rock up the hill, over the top, and now it's picking up speed on its own.

  Don your protective elbow pads, grease your hubs, and stick new griptape to your deck because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

      Long time immersive web creator James Baicoianu has published a [detailed HOWTO](https://bai.dev/projects/webxr-electron-apr2021) about using the [Electron wrapper utility](https://www.electronjs.org/) to create installable native applications that behind the scenes are WebXR experiences running in Chromium. Web designers and developers can now deploy their experiences via the web or (theoretically) via app stores from Valve, Epic, Itch, and Microsoft.

      Cloud rendering has landed with services like [Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/) and [Mighty App](https://www.mightyapp.com/) but while working in the Mozilla MR team (RIP ðŸ˜¿) Alan Jeffrey worked on streaming video of WebXR sessions from within the [Servo browser engine](https://servo.org/) and [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/). In [his recent talk](https://youtu.be/rAWeW6Q5Cuw) Alan talked about the origin and potential of this project.

      A large number of people have worked (many as volunteers) to make this happen so that WebAssembly and WASI can be the foundation on which we build a wider web.
      <blockquote><a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">The Bytecode Alliance</a>, a community dedicated to creating new software foundations, building on standards such as WebAssembly and WebAssembly System Interface (WASI), today announced incorporation as a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization.

      3D content editors like Blender and Maya have long provided visual tools for creators to animate both motion and properties like material colors. This week the Babylon team [revealed](https://babylonjs.medium.com/unleash-your-animations-with-ace-57c9b04cab2e) that they're bringing that capability to the Babylon scene editor. They have released an [early alpha demonstration](https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#9WUJN#1402) for the community to test and to encourage feedback. Features like this curve editor will enable more creators (including non-coders) to implement their vision of the immersive web.

      One missing piece from Unity-to-Web exporters like [this one](https://github.com/De-Panther/unity-webxr-export) has been support for networked replication. Multi-user support requires this feature so it's great news to hear from Max Weisel that the popular [Normcore replication library has an alpha build that targets the web](https://twitter.com/maxweisel/status/1387813804357083147). Details are light but should it go live it will fill an important gap for Unity projects.

      While I usually cover new hand libraries and models (see below for an example) this immersive experience uses hands in a different mode: as source material for art. [Kitae Kim](https://www.kitaedesigns.com/)'s new [sculpture park](https://twitter.com/kitaedesigns/status/1388844002284347396) incorporates many scans of the artists hands.

      The W3C Immersive Web Community Group's [library of input profiles and models](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-input-profiles) is quickly becomming the default tool to show controllers in WebXR. This week Tianrui "Felix" Zhang from the Facebook Reality Lab [contributed generic hand models](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-input-profiles/pull/197) and (after a [bit of help](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-input-profiles/pull/198) from Brandon Jones of Google) developers can now hit the ground running with [WebXR hand input](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-hand-input/). One day after the models arrived, [Max announced support in Wonderland](https://twitter.com/mrmaxm/status/1387461212829540355).
      <br style="margin-bottom: 15px" />
      This is the sort of cross-org collaboration that is rarely organized anywhere other than in standards bodies. Go, team!
