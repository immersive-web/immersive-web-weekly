overview: >
  Northern Summer continues to take a toll on our community's productivity but have no fear because some of us stayed inside to model, design, record, code, and write about the wider web. I'm thrilled to see more experiences from artists, educators, and community leaders as it is a sign that we're shifting from a developer-centric phase into wider use.

  Lace up your hiking boots, refill your water bottles, and restock your first aid kits because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

      Rik Cabanier of Facebook [announced](https://twitter.com/rcabanier/status/1403359800621076485) that the new release of the Quest's browser supports the [WebXR foveation API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/#dom-xrwebgllayer-fixedfoveation). This gives developers the ability to change the amount of rendering work that their app performs. The [Oculus docs](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unreal/unreal-ffr/) have more information about fixed foveation, too.

      <blockquote>Like last year, the UW’s Allen School and Reality Lab held the capstone course virtually. All seven of the participating teams used WebXR for more flexibility to accommodate remote students. WebXR is an API standard that lets developers create VR and AR apps without using headsets.
      <br />
        Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman, an associate professor at the Allen School, said WebXR helped students learn VR faster. The platform helped “level the playing field” for students working from home.</blockquote>

They specifically call out WebXR as a topic so hopefully it will be more than a venue for app store app developers.
