  Though this is my last issue as editor of the Immersive Web Weekly (see [issue 77](https://immersivewebweekly.com/issues/077/index.html) for details) there are still many "firsts" ahead for the immersive web. There's no end to the end of hard work and lofty goals waiting for people in this community. Those specifications won't write themselves. Our events won't self-organize. VR rigs won't pop out of printers (yet).

  The wider web community stands ready to amaze and confuse us by using our work in ways that we never considered. Thank all of you for amazing and confusing me for 68 issues.

  Install your dependencies, generate your make files, and fire up your compiler because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!
