      After [announcing Chrome's autplay policy change](https://blog.google/products/chrome/improving-autoplay-chrome/)
      earlier this month, requiring user gesture before enabling media content, the Chrome
      team received pushback from creative developers who have had audio-driven 3D and VR experiences
      broken from the change.
      Chrome is now temporarily rolling back the new policy for Web Audio, with plans on re-enabling
      [the new policy](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=840866#c103) in October.
