  It seems like the immersive web had a quiet week as Summer fully arrives in the Northern hemisphere. Sadly, in Seattle we have "June-uary" so I took those quiet moments to wrap up by a warm fire, drink hot tea, and design a few lens polishing tools for an optical assembly for face pontoons.

  Grind your end mills, zero out your DRO, and square your stock because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

      In a bit of a surprise, the Igalia team [announced](https://twitter.com/f_jimenez/status/1392136708465045509) this week that they have the fully open source WebXR implementation in the embeddable WebKit library ([WPE](https://wpewebkit.org/)) running on Android. They used this to replace the Gecko engine in a build of Mozilla's Firefox Reality immersive browser as demonstrated in a video in [this blog post](https://ferjm.github.io/wpe/webkit/android/2021/05/10/wpe-webkit-android.html). Is there a future for Firefox Reality without Mozilla?!

      Also this week, Igalia engineer (and Ex-Mozillian) [Imanol Fernandez](https://twitter.com/MortimerGoro/) detailed the work behind their WebXR implementation in [an internal codecamp talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gKoh66LYaw).
