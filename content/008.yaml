  Summer went by just like that. I've been super slow sending this out, so thanks for your patience! In just a few weeks, everyone's talking about the released Magic Leap One, the Global WebXR Hackathon ends as JS13k with WebXR begins, and the Immersive Web Working Group charter is coming together to push the WebXR Device API into a W3C proposed recommendation. Dig in & enjoy!

      The ultra-anticipated mixed reality headset [Magic Leap One] was finally made available
      for public purchase earlier this month at $2295. The [Helio] web browser is also shipping on
      the platform, with documentation for the [Helio SDK](https://magicleaphelio.com/devsamples/)
      for declaratively creating 3D web content in XR. There are a lot of takes out there,
      but I've enjoyed [Avaer Kazmer]'s hands-on developer review,
      ["Magic Leap One: Vive for AR](https://medium.com/webmr/magic-leap-one-vive-forar-3a86084e31ff),
      [Adario Strange](https://creator.wonderhowto.com/adario/)'s
      [review of the Helio browser](https://magic-leap.reality.news/news/hands-on-magic-leaps-helio-app-is-best-window-into-web-available-augmented-reality-0186508/),
      and if you're into hardware guts, [iFixit has a great teardown of the Magic Leap One](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Magic+Leap+One+Teardown/112245).

      The draft charter for the Immersive Web Working Group is currently under review.
      The [Immersive Web Community Group] that has been working on WebXR standards will
      now create a working group: a more formal process for pushing the [WebXR Device API]
      into a W3C proposed recommendation.

      [JS13k Games](https://js13kgames.com/) is a JavaScript competition to create an experience in under 13 kilobytes, adding a new [WebXR category](http://js13kgames.com/webxr) this year, allowing [A-Frame] and [Babylon.js] to be used without counting against the file limit. I've been slow sending this out, and there's 13 more days, so add 1kb of code every day on top of either WebVR framework and give it a go!
