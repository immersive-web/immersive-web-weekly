  With temperatures upwards of 100f (38c) in Seattle (a land with few air conditioners) it has been a bit tricky for me to work with hot computers but that didn't stop the global community from stitching together more of the immersive web. I'm seeing an uptick in projects that bring higher quality embodiment and rendered bodies into browsers at the same time that WebXR sessions can be started outside of the context of major web browsers. It's an exciting time for teleportation!

  I'm taking a break from editing for the next two weeks in order to take advantage of the extra photons that Seattle offers during July but the IWW will be back on the 13th with more news from the wider web.

  Set up your fans, put ice packs in your shirt, and stay cool in the basement because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

summary: Ready Player Me, Firefox Reality, Rhodonite, and the Shaka

      I thought that Firefox Reality was on the back-burner at Mozilla so it was a bit of a surprise to read [Robert Long's tweet](https://twitter.com/arobertlong/status/1408491218267295748) that it is shipping with the new stand-alone headset from Vive, the Focus 3. This is confirmed in a [Tom's Hardware review](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/vive-focus-3-vr-headset) but details about Mozilla's future plans for this immersive browser are hard to find.

      According to Sean McBeth, it's possible to [start WebXR sessions from Edge's embedded web view](https://twitter.com/Sean_McBeth/status/1408899273857585152) so in theory Windows App Store apps could use immersive web tools to provide AR and VR experiences.
