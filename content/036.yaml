overview: >
  We're only 1/12th of the way through 2021 and the immersive web community is already building on the momentum from 2020! Unity toolmakers are hard at work making bridges for native app developers to cross over into WebXR. Big platform companies are joining forces to provide more spatial foundations. Fans are creating homage experiences to their favorite fictional universes.

      Magic Leap [announced](https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/news/partner-stories/magic-leap-announces-partnership-with-google-cloud-to-build-the-next-era-of) that they intend to sell access to their cloud technologies through the Google Cloud Marketplace, including access to their "Communication, Collaboration, and Co-presense" platform. It's unclear at this time what form these offerings will take but it's interesting to see Magic Leap continue their pivot toward enterprise customers and web technologies.

      Owen Weizman [announced](https://twitter.com/DePanther/status/1356378210288758792) this week that with help from the folks at [Needle Tools](https://needle.tools/) they're bringing support for Unity's [XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@0.9/manual/index.html) to the [Unity WebXR Export](https://github.com/De-Panther/unity-webxr-export) library. This means that many existing Unity applications using XR Interaction Toolkit will be one step closer to working on the immersive web. One stunning example is [Silk Brush](https://twitter.com/msub2official/status/1355959135314059267), the port of the [newly open-sourced TiltBrush](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/01/the-future-of-tilt-brush.html) code base to WebXR.

Their new design looks great, too!

      Today is the final day of the [fully WebXR-accessed New Frontiers program](https://fpg.festival.sundance.org/film/ntf/catalog) at the Sundance Film Festival. This year is the first year that the festival has fully embraced the immersive web and it's worth catching a film to experience how they've approached the complex issues and history of the program.

    title: On Demand Metaverse Panels

      Last week's online conference from the GamesBeat portion of VentureBeat spent two days exploring the topic of "Into The Metaverse". If you missed the panels then don't worry because they're now [available on demand for free](https://venturebeat.com/event/gbfbsummit/on-demand/#/). I attended many of the panels and was generally discouraged that speakers used phrases like "colonizing the metaverse" and several times said something like "We should create something like the W3C" without being aware (or being willfully ignorant) that existing standards bodies are already at work on a global platform for XR.
        <br style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        I see a lot of opportunity for the immersive web community to reach into the games community and show them that we have common problems and goals.

      This [fan-created experience](https://spiderman.webvr.link/) gives us the opportunity to swing through a city like your friendly neighborhood Spiderman. If you've wondered whether you have your ["VR legs"](https://xinreality.com/wiki/VR_legs) then this method of locomotion is a quick test. Please be aware that a negative result can be seriously negative. ðŸ¤¢ The [source code is available](https://github.com/talkol/spiderman) for those who want to experiment with nausea avoidance methods.
