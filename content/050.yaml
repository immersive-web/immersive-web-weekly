      Thanks to work by [Sara Viera](https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW) and others in the [Poimandres collective](https://twitter.com/pmndrs), a [new "dev-first" asset market is taking shape](https://twitter.com/0xca0a/status/1390312797326688262). Assets will be available via the `npm install` command and Lewy Blue recently revealed that [he's scraping public models from the Poly service](https://twitter.com/lewy_blue/status/1390633012790906885) so there will be a large selection of models at launch.

      Long-time reporter on XR and the tech that surrounds it Cathy Hackl [launched a new series](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/05/08/metaverse-weekly-brands-stories-and-investments-dispatched-from-the-metaverse/?sh=1c4ffd845d6e) on Forbes to focus on "the metaverse".
