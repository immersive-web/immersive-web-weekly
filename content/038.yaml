  The news that Sundance's web-based [New Frontier hosted nearly 40k visitors](https://vrroom.buzz/vr-news/immersive-arts/sundances-virtual-new-frontier-got-almost-40k-visits) (38k more than previous events) gave me a lift this week despite Seattle being snowed in and locked down. Based on my streams it continues to feel like our community has hit its stride in 2021 and end user uptake is entering a bit of an upward knee curve.

  Tuck your personal items under your seat, pull down on the bar until it locks in place, and keep your hands inside the car at all times because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

      [This survey](https://www.vrfocus.com/2021/02/defining-the-next-normal-for-immersive-concert-experiences/) of the state of online festivals focuses on organizations and platforms that have found success and then it turns toward the future:
      <blockquote>The most promising arena to host virtual concerts may be that of WebXR. This “platform” can already host high-quality 2D, 360 and volumetric video, and it’s the only 3D arena that doesn’t require downloading an app-container to access, this latent state seems anomalous. Perhaps the only thing standing in the way of a proper coming-out party for WebXR is the existence of a seminal event with a noteworthy artist.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>The goal of this Industry Connections activity is to continue and proliferate the existing efforts of The IEEE Standards Association focused on the ethical issues related to XR as outlined in the Extended Reality chapter of Ethically Aligned Design while inviting Working Group members from the multiple standards Working Groups focused on augmented and virtual reality and the spatial web and additional subject matter experts from industry and policy to create white papers, workshops, and PARs related to this work to ensure these technologies move from perilous to purposeful.</blockquote>
      Editor's translation: They're holding meetings and then collaboratively writing a whitepaper on ethics in XR.

The [abstract deadline](https://ismar21.org/call-for-papers/) is March 7th and it would be fantastic to see more representation from the immersive web community.
