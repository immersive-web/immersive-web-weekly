      While several augmented reality APIs have been incubating over the last few months
      ([hit test](https://github.com/immersive-web/hit-test),
      [lighting estimation](https://github.com/immersive-web/lighting-estimation),
      [anchors](https://github.com/immersive-web/anchors)), the first scene understanding
      feature has been [merged](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/blob/8e1c06511b420a30d34878c472416bd604747cb9/hit-testing-explainer.md)
      into the WebXR Device API proper. The new [hit test explainer](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/blob/8e1c06511b420a30d34878c472416bd604747cb9/hit-testing-explainer.md)
      describes new methods that allow applications to raycast into the real-world
      and collisions conveying found geometry. Note that this proposed API differs from
      the [implementation in Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/06/ar-for-the-web),
      based off of the [original proposal](https://github.com/immersive-web/hit-test).
