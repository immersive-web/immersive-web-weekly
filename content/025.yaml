  Note: There will be no Immersive Web Weekly next week because your editor will be in an underground bunker at an undisclosed location with no Internet access. That this is happening during the U.S. presidential election is entirely a coincidence. ðŸ˜‰
  <br style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  I feel pretty good today because I just heard that the Bytecode Alliance's [Wasmtime team is once again funded](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/1-year-update#the-lucet-and-wasmtime-teams-join-forces) and NASA [detected H<sup>2</sup>O on the sunlit parts of Luna](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-sofia-discovers-water-on-sunlit-surface-of-moon). Editing this newsletter and seeing the hard work happening in our community to bring the immersive web to more people has also lightened my mood. I don't say it enough but I am deeply grateful for everyone in this community and for the work that you do.
  <br style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  Calm your breath, ground into the Earth, and practice your sun salutations because it's time for another Immersive Web Weekly!

      Thanks to editor [Manish Goregaokar](https://twitter.com/Manishearth) and the rest of the Immersive Web Working Group, the specification for [hand input for WebXR](https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/WD-webxr-hand-input-1-20201022/) has reached another milestone in the process of standardization. These "first published working drafts" are often the first versions of proposed specifications that are seen outside of working groups and are considered worthy of comment by members of the W3C and by the wider web community of creators. Great work, everyone!

      Spec co-editor, Brandon Jones, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Tojiro/status/1320864271928979456) that there are newly updated 3D models in the [WebXR Input Profiles](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-input-profiles/) library. Users wearing Facebook's Quest 2 or HP's Reverb will now see the correct controllers and there's no code change necessary for users of the freely hosted version of the profiles. This library is a nice example of cross-organization collaboration to make the immersive web a better place for creators and users.
