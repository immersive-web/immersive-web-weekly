overview: >
  As we head into the last few weeks of 2020 I was tempted to recount the many milestones, victories, and heartaches that took place on the immersive web and in our community. Luckily, we are spared that bit of sappy writing by a week that has been packed full of interesting news and events.
  Clear your schedule, shut down social media, and turn off all alerts because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

      The combination of pandemic restrictions and more commonly available XR hardware has energized the market for spatial chat applications, many of them web based. In [this Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/zoom-parties-proximity-chat/), Internet linguist [Gretchen McCullock](https://gretchenmcculloch.com/) explores why this is happening and examines different approaches taken by the [40+ spatial chat projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FgynDnnrrllZZUa42XcKSfD68G5VAMZsLkARXHtgHOM/) that she tracks. In related news, ex-Mozilla Hubs manager Greg Fodor [announced](https://gfodor.medium.com/introducing-jel-the-un-zoom-320d3dcfd8f6) his own web-based spatial chat application, [Jel](https://jel.app/).

      [MoleculARweb](https://molecularweb.epfl.ch/) is a new marker-based AR web app [announced by EPFL](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/augmented-reality-makes-chemistry-and-biology-acce/) for use by chemistry students. A chemistry educator and an immersive web developer teamed up to create this multi-language site and they documented the process in [this academic paper](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/preprint/MoleculARweb_A_Website_for_Chemistry_and_Structural_Biology_Education_Through_Interactive_Augmented_Reality_out_of_the_Box_in_Commodity_Devices/13012463). I'm looking forward to seeing [WebXR demos like this](https://twitter.com/fabiojcortes/status/1335918809828438018) make their way into more educational experiences on the immersive web.

      The [glTF standard](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) has quickly become the preferred syntax for 3D models on the web and in technical artists' workflows. This week the standards body that develops glTF [announced new extensions](https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-wave-of-new-gltf-pbr-3d-material-capabilities) to it's physically based materials: clear coat, transmission, and sheen. Support for these new extensions is either already present or in development for Microsoft's Babylon.js, Google's Filament, and Three.js engines so expect to see them soon on the immersive web.
