overview: >
  The news this week is filled with governments and corporations disagreeing about the essential nature of progress and the future of humanity. It's a lot. One bright spot that warms my heart is the progress that this community (that's you!) continues to make toward a cross-platform, standards based, and open immersive web. Don your long robes, powder your wig, and polish your gavel because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly.

  Note: This is the last issue of the IWW for 2020 as I will be spending the next two weeks attempting to eat my weight in holiday candy and cookies. I wish you all a safe and joyous new year and I'll see you on the other side.

      <blockquote>The Oculus Quest 2 requires a Facebook account to work, something widely criticized by reviewers and VR fans. Germany's competition authority <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55274547">now says</a> that requirement could be an abuse of Facebook's dominant market position.</blockquote>
      Facebook [previously stopped sales of the Quest 2](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54014217) in Germany because of regulations that prevent merging data from its otherwise separate services.

      Last week the W3C's Technical Architecture Group [met](https://github.com/w3ctag/meetings/blob/gh-pages/2020/telcons/12-07-minutes.md) and reviewed two proposed extensions to WebXR: [Layers](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/528) and [Hand input](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/568). Feedback has been generally positive and I'm hopeful that both proposals will be completed and approved in early 2021.

      Last week's announcement that Google Poly is decimated* prompted at least one web creator to build a similar editor using WebXR. In [this tweet](https://twitter.com/dannyaroslavski/status/1338030154900066305), Danny Yaroslavski gave us a look at the new [Nearfiction XR editor](https://nearfiction.com/xr/) which is still in development but already provides file export for local persistence of your work.

      Prolific creator Ricardo Cabello (aka Mrdoob) [announced this week](https://twitter.com/mrdoob/status/1337068939776581632) that the Hopalong Orbits Visualizer (long a favorite Three.js demo) [is now in WebXR](https://hopalongvr.glitch.me/) for a relaxing distraction from world events. For the curious, this is a Glitch project so it's easy to [take a look behind the scenes](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/hopalongvr).
