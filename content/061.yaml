overview: >
  Despite having a ton of fun, I took a break from playing [Worlds Demolisher](https://worldsdemolisher.totalviz.com/) to survey the hard work coming out of our community and friends it's amazing! More events are in production. More industries are finding out about WebXR. More teams are meeting in immersive spaces. More technologies are maturing.

  Put down those wands, take off that headset, and let those batteries recharge because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

summary: More Summits, more CAD, more Mirrors, and more Voxels

    title: Webaverse Completes the Digital Body Challenge

      One consistent request since the beginning of XR on the web has been for "full" digital bodies with inverse kinematics for tracking, open source for portability, and support for de facto digital body standards like VRM and Ready Player Me. [Webaverse](https://github.com/webaverse/app) seems to have heard those requests and met the challenge. The open code natively supports VRM and apparently [Ready Player Me bodies can be converted to VRM](https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1402476800022884357).
