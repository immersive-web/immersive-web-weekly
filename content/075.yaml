overview: >
  As the holiday season rolls in, newly excited analysts around the world watch for signals that XR is taking off while long-time creators of the immersive web continue to lay down crucial foundations. It's not a job filled with glory so if you're giving thanks this week then perhaps reach out with kudos to our spec editors, chairs, browser teams, and community contributors.

  Seal up those windows, insulate your walls, and snuggle into a pile of blankets because it's time for another toasty issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

  Note: The IWW team (OK, it's just me) is taking off the rest of this year for a bit of holiday rest and relaxation. I'll see you back here in 2022!

      Photogrammetry, typically the realm of native apps, joined the immersive web with Polycam's [announcement](https://twitter.com/Polycam3D/status/1462889379479781376) that they've ported their engine to browsers. Collect images using whatever camera you have on hand, upload them to the Polycam site, change a few settings, and then download the resulting 3D files for use in any application, native or browser-based.
