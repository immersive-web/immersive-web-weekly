overview: >
  This was a busy week for the immersive web and for your editor. New APIs are in play, WebXR games (some quite sticky) are now live, and it feels like each week a new galaxy of tutorials and guides show up in my telescope. Patch over your light leaks, tune up your signal processing algorithms, and point your radio array at these coordinates because it's time for another Immersive Web Weekly!

      [Moon Rider](https://moonrider.xyz/) was one of the first WebVR experiences with high quality graphics and stable performance which led it to become a common demonstration for people interested in the immersive web. It turns out that it's more than a demo for many people because the creator [tweeted this week](https://twitter.com/dmarcos/status/1312868636797939717) that 18 months after release it has more than 500 users who play every day for more than 15 minutes.
