  Heck yes, it has been another exciting week on the immersive web. The GIS community is digging into the capabilities of WebXR for shared construction visualization at the same time that the art community is changing hearts and minds with galleries, live immersive shows, and boundary-pushing exploration of embodiment. It's a wild combination.

      <blockquote>DY3CORPIA is the third iteration of Dyscorpia: Future Intersections of the Body and Questions. In the shadow of COVID-19 and blinding light of the screen, DY3CORPIA is being hosted in a digital twin of Enterprise Square Galleries where the first DYSCORPIA was mounted in 2019. DY3CORPIA artists continue to interrogate the increasingly complex intersections of the body and technology in an entirely virtual, simulated space that we have to navigate with our fingers rather than our whole bodies.</blockquote>
