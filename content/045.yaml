  While I patiently wait for [dance man](https://twitter.com/ronchoqa/status/1378762880338817031) to ship in order to live out my dream of first-person Pac-Man, the rest of our community refused to sit still. From the largest deployment of headsets to using sound to augment light, this week ran the gamut.

  Heat the pan, pour the oil, prep the spices, and chop the onions because it's time to cook up another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly.

      To most people, the detection of planes seems like an abstract concept but to experience creators the planes detected in the world around us are walls, floors, tables, and other crucial features that contribute to a well formed reality. This week Google [announced their intent to ship](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/51Yd2t6quik/m/6AWd7G07CAAJ) the [WebXR plane detection API](https://immersive-web.github.io/real-world-geometry/plane-detection.html). In related news, a few folks noticed that [Google is once again hiring AR hardware people](https://twitter.com/haltor/status/1379169927056199681).

      The [GIFs and notes](https://twitter.com/zach_geek/status/1376237276691369990) about this new immersive web experience are a fascinating exploration of sound as another channel of information for interaction design:
      <blockquote>In the Kromophone, color is separated into channels for red, yellow, green, blue, and white. The intensity of each channel gets mapped to its own voice, which specifies a pitch, a pan, and a timbre. The intensity of each color channel controls the gain of each audio channel</blockquote>
