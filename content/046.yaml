  Another amazing week just happened in the immersive web community including a big announcement from the WebXR Awards team, some Flooming from Google, a [spatial rhythm creator](https://twitter.com/RaananW/status/1381646138596597760),  and a number of awe inspiring technological releases that will (without exaggerating) change the fundamental nature of XR experiences.

  The pace of news is picking up so soon I may need to implement a "short links" section of each issue where I simply name and link to pages instead of writing up a paragraph with context. I love that we now have this problem!

  Get a haircut, put on your make-up, check your ring light, and iron your dress because it's time to livestream another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!

      February's WebXR Awards event was good fun and a great way to gather the community so I'm excited that the production team behind that event [announced](https://twitter.com/webxrawards/status/1381811826992816129) a new, developer-focused event on May 25th: [The WebXR Developer Summit](https://webxrawards.com/). [Tickets are free and available now on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2021-webxr-developer-summit-tickets-149418602061). The live event will be streamed on flat screens and into viewing parties in shared XR spaces across several platforms with me (Trevor Flowers) signed up to be the event host and to moderate a few of the discussions.

      With the art world in a tizzy over the sale (and associated pollution) of blockchain-hosted Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), it should be no surprise that technical artists working with XR are joining the movement. [Hic et Nunc](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/) seems to be the [platform](https://twitter.com/johnbenton/status/1380534818665029632) of [choice](https://twitter.com/1x1_NFT/status/1381320632185524225) for [our community](https://twitter.com/mrdoob/status/1372877570543382529) which has the nice characteristic of using Tezos, one of the less pollution-creating technologies. Along with the more established XR+crypto spaces like [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/) and [SomniumSpace](https://somniumspace.com/), these new art sales platforms bring more payment and sharing options to the immersive web.

      <blockquote>Diego Marcos is one of the most important figures in WebXR’s story so far. At Mozilla he helped kickstart the WebVR standard, which then became WebXR. He co-created A-Frame, an open source library to create VR experiences on the web, and remains its lead developer, maintainer, community manager. Marcos now works at Supermedium, a company he co-founded in 2018, developing WebXR showcases and a new kind of browser for VR headsets. We sat down with Diego in our virtual studio to talk about all of the above, and the future of WebXR as an approach to immersive content</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Foveated rendering is a technique where a region of the HMD screen is sampled at a higher shading rate. The first version of NVIDIA's VRSS supported fixed foveated rendering in the center. The latest version of VRSS 2 expands on foveated rendering and supports gaze tracking by integrating eye-tracking technology. Now the foveated region is dynamic and changes based on where the user looks. VRSS is a zero-coding solution, so developers do not need to add any code to implement VRSS.</blockquote>
