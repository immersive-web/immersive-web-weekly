      <blockquote>"One of the most well-known problems with physically-inspired interactions in virtual reality is that the virtual world provides no physical feedback.

      <blockquote>"IFrames are really useful for WebXR. Often WebXR web pages are large with a lot of code and many 3D frameworks default to taking up all the available space on the page. IFrames solve these issues by letting you <a href="https://ada.is/blog/2021/01/07/using-webxr-in-html-iframes/">put all the XR code into another webpage</a>, which can even be on a different domain, they also let you choose exactly how much space they take up on the page and can be used with Flexbox and CSS Grid."</blockquote>
