  The discourse about the metaverse and Meta continues to froth up my timelines, with web3 ([sic](https://twitter.com/TrevorFSmith/status/1455873579329810440)) and the immersive web being floated as alternatives to scary walled gardens. As a result, it was good fun to take a break from [noodling with an idea](https://twitter.com/TrevorFSmith/status/1456032122553184258) and [making 1:6 scale Memex](https://twitter.com/TrevorFSmith/status/1457717329953918987) to find a few tasty links for you!
