  This issue of the IWW will land in your inbox a bit earlier than usual because *today* I'm hosting the [2021 WebXR Developer Summit](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2021-webxr-developer-summit-tickets-149418602061), an all-day free event featuring as many browser teams, library writers, and immersive web creators as we can pack into 8 (!) hours of live-streamed conversations.

summary: Dev Summit, WebGPU, Layers, and Poimandres
