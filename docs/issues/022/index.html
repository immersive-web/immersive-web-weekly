          <p><a href="https://moonrider.xyz/">Moon Rider</a> was one of the first WebVR experiences with high quality graphics and stable performance which led it to become a common demonstration for people interested in the immersive web. It turns out that it's more than a demo for many people because the creator <a href="https://twitter.com/dmarcos/status/1312868636797939717">tweeted this week</a> that 18 months after release it has more than 500 users who play every day for more than 15 minutes.</p>
