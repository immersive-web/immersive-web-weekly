      <div id="overview">
        <p>As Autumn arrives in Seattle, I look forward to leaving behind all of this lovely, sunny weather and spending time in new headsets. After more than three months on backorder, Valve has let me pay for an Index so when it arrives I plan to build interaction prototypes with WebXR that take advantage of the unique capabilities of both the Quest 2's hand tracking and the Knuckles controllers. I've heard that Collabora has good support for the Index so I also look forward to trying their OpenXR stack, <a href="https://monado.dev/">Monado</a>.

  This week we have good news from the KaiXR and PlayCanvas teams as well as a milestone for the immersive web in the form of a thorough Udemy course. Put on your woolly sweater and pour a mug of cheer because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!</p> <span>– Trevor Flowers</span>

          <p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-webxr/?couponCode=SEP20_SALE">This video course</a> introduces the core concepts of <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/">WebXR</a> by stepping students through the process of creating an architectural walk-through, a game, and a basic training application.
