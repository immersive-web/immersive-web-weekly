          <p>This week Snap (makers of the <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/">Snapchat</a> social app) <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Spectacles/status/1395442287367266304">announced at their nicely produced developer event</a> a reinvention of their <a href="https://www.spectacles.com/">sleekly integrated Spectacles glasses</a>, now with immersive augmented displays and a custom development platform, Lens Studio, but with no web support. <br /> Also this week the <a href="https://discord.gg/9TtZhb4">developer discord</a> for the open and modular <a href="https://docs.projectnorthstar.org/">North Star AR headset</a> discussed their roadmap and upcoming kickstarter from <a href="https://combinereality.com/">Combine Reality</a>. They also discussed new WebXR support on linux via <a href="https://webkit.org/wpe/">WPE</a>. <br /> These two events and projects represent two ends of a spectrum that runs from hypercorp-funded, locked, one-app-fits-all glasses to global communities of (usually under-funded) collaborators sharing designs and software for custom AR rigs.</p>

          <p>This essay explores the motivation and experiences of a teacher using XR and the web to engage his students: <blockquote>I did what any disillusioned teacher would do and bought 6 Go-Pro cameras, a tripod and some software, and started experimenting with web-based virtual reality taking panoramic photographs around London. I learnt some code, annotated some of the objects within those images and then uploaded them to a server so that my students with certain smartphones (i.e., those with motion-sensing features) could insert their device into a cardboard VR headset and get a sense of immersion in the English-speaking world with the advantage of interacting with their surroundings.  That was the turning point.</blockquote></p>

          <p>With a paper title like <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frvir.2021.668181/full">"Social Virtual Reality Platform Comparison and Evaluation Using a Guided Group Walkthrough Method"</a> you know that it will be good: <blockquote>We developed a usability inspection method based on cognitive walkthrough that we call guided group walkthrough. Guided group walkthrough is applied to existing social VR platforms by having a guide walk the participants through a series of abstract social tasks that are common across the platforms. Using this method we compared six social VR platforms for the Oculus Quest. After constructing an appropriate task hierarchy and walkthrough question structure for social VR, we ran several groups of participants through the walkthrough process. We undercover usability challenges that are common across the platforms, identify specific design considerations and comment on the utility of the walkthrough method in this situation.</blockquote></p>
