In June 2020, Eyebeam put out a call to untangle important questions around societyâ€™s relationship to emerging technology, and to put forward real-world solutions. The event will feature timely inquiries and tactics from field leaders on topics ranging from consensual coding to interspecies communications.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>Between 2018 and 2020 I set aside some of my time to research a subject Iâ€™ve been passionate about for many years: What is the real potential of AR on the Urban context? ... Can AR media effectively be integrated in cities? How can it be truly useful for users? At what privacy cost would it come about? How would a centralized AR platform fit in todayâ€™s tech macro-economy?</blockquote>

          <blockquote>A number of 3D captures apps got recently released to take advantage of this new capability. Iâ€™ve tested pretty much all of them, and have been scanning extensively for the past 3 months. I often get asked which apps do I recommend, and how do I get nice captures. Here is a post about my go-to apps, what I like about each of them, and some general tips for iPhone lidar scanning. So here are my 6 go-to scanning apps, they all come with direct export to Sketchfab.</blockquote>
