      <div id="overview">
        <p>This week I spent most of my time elbow-deep in resin printers making prototypes of new wearable mechatronics and feeling excited about the future of the immersive web. The up-tick in creator activity that started in January has only picked up speed and now my feeds are packed with exciting work as well as rumors and teasers of even more to come. Some days it is so hectic that I need to take a break and play a bit of <a href="https://twitter.com/Sorskoot/status/1374844578268913670">sci-fi music</a> to calm my nerves. <br style="margin-bottom: 15px" /> Glue on your silicone ear tips, shave your eyebrows into a non-human shape, and zip into your unitard because it's time for another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly!</p>

          <p>Our very own co-chair, Ayşegül Yönet, continues to be a powerhouse of content for immersive web creators, this time with a nicely produced tutorial series: <blockquote> In this course, you’ll see the possibilities of 3D on the web and with the new WebXR device APIs. We will use three different libraries to create 3D experiences: Three.js, Bablyon.js, and AFrame. And finally, you will add augmented reality and virtual reality support into your 3D scenes.</blockquote></p>

          <h2><a href="https://www.berlinartlink.com/2021/03/29/virtual-reality-tina-sauerlaender-interview/" target="_new">An Interview with Art Historian Tina Sauerlaender</a></h2>
          <p>Sauerlaender is the artistic director of the VR ART PRIZE, the co-founder and director of the international exhibition platform peer to space, and also the co-founder and CEO of the international online research database for VR art, Radiance VR. She has smart things to say about performance on the immersive web: <blockquote>It’s easier for opera houses and theaters because the stage and the audiences are usually separate, so the experience is similar to what it has always been: you sit in a chair and watch the performance, but now you do it from home. It’s also easier for users to participate because everyone knows how to play a video and how to scroll through a website. Those are big advantages. But when a museum is thinking about showing a virtual exhibition space on the internet, these simple skills are not enough. In a physical museum, everyone knows: you go to the ticket office, buy a ticket, and then you look at the exhibition. But online it’s different. You’re suddenly standing in the digital space and you have to move, but you don’t know how.</blockquote></p>

          <p>The new <a href="https://github.com/actnwit/RhodoniteTS">Rhodonite WebGL library</a> ticks a lot of boxes on the list of features one would want as the foundation for an immersive web experience. It's an entity component system, supports modern data formats like glTF and VRM, and it even supports the hot new Basis Universal compressed texture format. Even more interestingly, it claims to use a unique memory architecture: <blockquote>With the Blittable Memory Architecture, Rhodonite stores almost all of its data in a large pre-allocated ArrayBuffer. Data storage for matrix or vector classes in Rhodonite's component classes and materials are assigned from the memory pool, which means most of the data are on that memory pool, transferred to the GPU every frame as a floating-point texture. This architecture allows all shaders always to access a vast amount of data.
  <br />
  For example, Rhodonite can handle and blend all morph targets (38 targets) of VRM characters simultaneously in the shader.</blockquote>
