        <p>After a run of exciting (perhaps too exciting) weeks it has been a relief to have a bit of a break from world-shaking announcements. Despite the trials of 2020 we're all still here, many of us are still working on XR, and a variety of interesting new projects and discussions have surfaced. Pour a cup of herbal tea, wrap up in a blanket, and quietly peruse another issue of the Immersive Web Weekly.</p> <span>– Trevor Flowers</span>

          <p>After running a series of experiments to test security concepts for link traversal on the immersive web, researcher Jessica Outlaw identified the three primary benefits of using networked VR for user studies. If lockdowns or state borders are hampering your ability to perform field work then this is the article for you.</p>

          <p>When school was canceled for his daughter the author turned that setback into an opportunity to encourage her interest in bugs and the outdoors by creating a <a href="http://www.havenmetrology.com/virtualzoo/">virtual zoo</a>. By combining a new CT scanner and the immersive web they've created a fascinating public resource for students and educators.</p>

          <p>Qualcomm and Ultraleap announced a multi-year agreement to bring camera-based hand tracking to stand-alone XR headsets that use the Snapdragon XR2 chipset. Ultraleap claims to provide the “fastest, most accurate, and most robust hand tracking.” Whether or not that's true, your editor looks forward to more competition for industry leader Facebook and more headroom for others to try business models that center around the immersive web.</p>
